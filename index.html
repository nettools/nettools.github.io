<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>The Nettools Project is a reusable implementation of network configuration
standards for Linux. At its core, it provides independent libraries that
implement the most common RFCs related to network configuration and management.
On top of these, it provides services that extend these libraries, as well as
other networking resources, to provide an integrated view of all these sources
at runtime.</p>

<p>The Nettools Project implements standards that are at the core of network
configuration. While many of these have been around for decades, the
implementations provided by the Nettools Project focus on a few key aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Policy</strong>: Every network standard that is implemented by the Nettools
               Project comes with a pure library implementation, that
               provides access to the standard without placing additional
               policies. These libraries provide networking standards that
               are as close to the respective specifications as possible,
               while placing limited to no restrictions on top.
               On the contrary, these implementations are explicitly written
               without any specific environments in mind, but allow any
               networking manager or service to make use of them. This also
               implies that the APIs allow full control of the protocol
               behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asynchronous</strong>: Since network safety is crucial today, all implementations
                  and services are provided with a fully asynchronous API.
                  This allows placing their instances into isolated
                  environments, while mapping the API to an asynchronous
                  message-based interface. That is, while the libraries
                  provide in-process APIs, they are explicitly written in a
                  way that they can be mapped easily to a message-based
                  communication channel. Adopters of these libraries are
                  highly recommended to isolate execution of these protocols
                  and make use of the asynchronous API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>21st Century</strong>: Networking standards like <em>DHCP</em> and <em>ACD</em> have been
                  around for decades. Thus, they were written against
                  hardware that was obsoleted many years ago. Modern
                  hardware often no longer fits the models used in the
                  70ths. Therefore, the nettools implementations try to port
                  old standards to modern hardware, providing knobs to tune
                  parameters that no longer apply in the 21st century (no,
                  today it is no longer acceptable to wait 9s on local links
                  for address conflict detection to finish).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Linux-Only</strong>: Network configuration requires explicit knowledge of the
                corresponding counter-parts in the kernel. While high-level
                APIs may resemble each other across UNIX Derivatives, the
                underlying technologies differ. The Nettools Project aligns
                all implementations with modern Linux Kernel releases and
                makes use of linux-only features to improve performance and
                security of these implementations.</p>

</ul>

      <a href="/n-acd/"><strong>n-acd</strong></a>:
      <em>IPv4 Address Conflict Detection</em>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>n-acd</em> project implements the <em>IPv4 Address Conflict Detection</em> standard
as defined in <em>RFC-5227</em>. The state machine is implemented in a shared library
and provides a stable <em>ISO-C11</em> API. The implementation is linux-only and
relies heavily on the API behavior of recent linux kernel releases.</p>
